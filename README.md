# Hello-World
Getting to know Git. 

And no goodbye cruel world this time
This time I'm staying.
Finally surrendered to the infinite potentiality of creation that code announces and make true.

I ve been studying the algorithmic turn (ML-AI, DATA) the last three years through philosophical, cultural and sociological perspectives. That was when I was getting my masters in Culture and Communications (ECO-UFRJ). I'm still reasearching those impacts and new paradigms via concepts like terraforming or technoGaia, but these are different topics about me.
I'm here to stay, that's for sure. I'm getting to know Git and JS and Python and .NET and C# and whatever tool that allows me to intervene in the world, to understand it, to change it.
I'm also a journalist and content writer. And a borning developer!
